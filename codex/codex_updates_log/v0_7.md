# v0_7 Update Log

Date: 2026-01-24

## Summary
- Added LLM review generation for blueprints (streaming)
- Switched Wall feed to Blueprints

## Backend
- New function: supabase/functions/analyze-blueprint/index.ts

## Frontend
- Blueprint builder now calls analyze-blueprint and streams review output
  - src/components/blueprint/BlueprintBuilder.tsx
- Wall now reads from blueprints + blueprint tags + likes
  - src/pages/Wall.tsx

## Notes
- Wall "Saved" tab removed for now (blueprint bookmarks not implemented).
- Wall links now go to /blueprint/:id.

## Next Steps
- Deploy analyze-blueprint function in Lovable and set LOVABLE_API_KEY.
- Consider adding blueprint bookmarks if needed.
