# MVP Readiness Checklist

## Core Flow (Inventory → Blueprint)
- [x] Inventory generate works end‑to‑end (prompt → categories/items).
- [ ] Inventory edit/customize works (add/remove items, tags).
- [x] Inventory build (steps/items) works and saves.
- [x] Blueprint review (LLM) works and returns output.
- [x] Publish blueprint works and shows in public feeds.
- [ ] Edit published blueprint works without breaking steps/items.
- [ ] Private blueprint stays private in all feeds.

## Discovery + Community
- [x] Wall/Explore/Blueprints pages load with content.
- [ ] Empty states are helpful and encourage action.
- [x] Tags are followable (Wall/Explore/Blueprint detail).
- [ ] Followed tags actually shape feed (For You / Explore).
- [ ] Sorting/filters feel clear and useful.

## Auth + Session
- [ ] Sign up + sign in are reliable.
- [ ] Session persists on refresh and across tabs.
- [ ] Logged‑out users get clear prompts, not dead ends.

## Agentic Backend
- [x] Backend health endpoint is up (`/api/health`).
- [x] Inventory generation uses agentic backend.
- [x] Blueprint review uses agentic backend.
- [x] Banner generation works via edge function.
- [ ] Friendly error messages for backend failures.

## Storage + Security
- [x] Banner uploads use edge function (no service role on server).
- [ ] RLS policies verified for public/private blueprints.
- [ ] CORS locked to prod domains only.
- [ ] Rate‑limit responses are user‑friendly.

## UX & Onboarding
- [x] Global Help overlay is available.
- [ ] Help overlay content feels complete + consistent with nav labels.
- [ ] Mobile layouts are usable (no clipped modals, buttons accessible).
- [ ] Loading states feel smooth (LLM calls, banner gen).

## Ops & Release
- [ ] Oracle deploy steps documented and repeatable.
- [ ] Monitoring plan (basic logs + health check).
- [ ] Rollback plan if deploy fails.
