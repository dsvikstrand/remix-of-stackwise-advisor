Please redeploy the Edge Function:

- supabase/functions/generate-inventory/index.ts

We updated the generation prompt to default to general item names and only become highly specific if the user explicitly asks for specificity. Also added “avoid brand names unless requested.”

Please confirm once the function is live.
