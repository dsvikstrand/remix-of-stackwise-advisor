- `docs/exec-plans/active/project-4-blueprint-detail-priority.md`  
  Planned next: blueprint detail hierarchy/content-priority refinement.
- `docs/exec-plans/active/project-5-metrics-validation.md`  
  Planned next: metrics/reporting deepening after telemetry baseline.
- `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`  
  Deferred work backlog and non-blocking engineering debt.

## Completed
- `docs/exec-plans/completed/project-1-ia-and-lingo.md`  
  Completed: channels-first terminology + IA baseline.

## Current Program Snapshot
- P1: completed.
- P2: completed.
- P3: active (runtime behavior + telemetry loop in operation).
- P4: planned.
- P5: planned.

## Rules
- Keep only truly active docs in `active/`.
- Move finished project plans into `completed/`.
- Update this index whenever status changes.
